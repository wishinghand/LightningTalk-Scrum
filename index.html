                <section>
                    <h2>Pros</h2>
                    <p>Large projects are divided into easily manageable sprints</p>
                    <p>Commits are coded and tested during the sprint review</p>
                    <p>Short sprints enable changes based on feedback a lot more easily</p>
                    <p>Progress is more clearly felt by Product Owners and Team Members</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Cons</h2>
                    <p>The chances of project failure are high if individuals aren't very committed or cooperative</p>
                    <p>The methodology can be hard to adopt on large teams</p>
                    <p>Can be susceptible to scope creep, less predictable outcomes</p>
                    <p>Early iterations are suboptimal (customer feedback helps fix this as iterations go on)</p>
